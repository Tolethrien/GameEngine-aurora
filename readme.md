# Misa Misa Game Engine! - Aurora API

This is the Aurora - module of Misa Engine, a 2D renderer based on WebGPU, built in a such way so that it can be used even without Misa.

### Modules

Engine is designed to consist of several modules which will eventually be combined into one application.

```
| Misa
| Editor - main graphical interface for Misa

| Aurora - WebGPU based custome 2D renderer
| Cello - Sound Module
| Dogma - ECS system
| MapMaker - module for the ease of creating worlds.

| NaviGPU - ingame GUI based on gpu
```

Core contains some version (stable) of all currently available modules. Marked with "x"
